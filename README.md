# SteganographyEncrypter

### About

Encrypting text into an image by changing the pixel's RGB values  
Probably only work with .png files   
Messy code  

Using [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)  

### Usage

Encrypt  
```
ImgEncrypter.exe imageName.png this text will be encrypted
```

Decrypt  
```
ImgEncrypter.exe imageName.png
```

### Note

I don't think this will work, C++ hard. Maybe works if OpenCV is installed and in your path.
